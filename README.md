# migrid-user-projects
A collection of user-projects that used to be bundled with the migrid codebase but are probably outdated and irrelevant to most deployments now.

This folder contains material related to specific MiG user projects in each sub folder.
The sub folders should be maintained by the responsible maintainer in collaboration with the migrid admins.

Project folders may contain anything from project descriptions to actual job examples.
